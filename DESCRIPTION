Description: Functions for meta-analysis of a single longitudinal and a single 
    time-to-event outcome from multiple studies using joint models.  Options to 
    produce plots for multi study joint data, to pool joint model fits from JM
    and joineR packages in a two stage meta-analysis, and to model multi-study 
    joint data in a one stage meta-analysis.
